# Project track A.Y. 2024-2025 DATA VISUALIZATION & TEXT MINING

Build a text processing pipeline that performs a text mining on a given corpus applying all the steps we saw during the lesson

The project MUST show:
*	Data Exploratory Analysis
    * Data preparation, cleaning: to clean the data from the raw dataset provided.
    * Exploratory Data Analysis using Data Visualization tools to show data variables from statistical distribution to linguistic information
    * LDA or NMF can be used, if needed, for studying the text distribution.
    * Present data in a visual way, using an interactive dashboard

* Neural Network approach 
  * Use one Neural Network model to classify the data (feed forward, RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM , GRU)
  * Show metrics with the implementation strategy 

* Transformer Based Approach
  * Use a Transformer based / Language Model model to classify the data (BERT/ROBERTA/ALBERT)
  * Show metrics with the implementation strategy 

* Compare the models

The project MUST be developed on Jupyter or Colab, and in a customer-ready form that means
* well-documented
* with descriptions about all the steps 
* all the materials to reproduce them such as data and models.

## Datasets
You can find the dataset into your team folder, available in this repository.

## Schedule
As all the exams are on Thursdays, the project as to be delivered by previous Tuesday 8pm CET.
