## Project track A.Y. 2023-2024 DATAVIZ &TEXT MINING (updated on Oct 22nd, 2023) 

Build a text processing pipeline that performs a text mining on a given corpus applying all the steps we saw during the lesson
The project must show:
*	Data Exploratory Analysis
**	Data preparation, cleaning: to clean the data from the raw dataset provided.
** Exploratory Data Analysis using Data Visualization tools to show data variables from statistical distribution to linguistic information
**LDA or NMF can be used, if needed, for studying the text distribution.
** Present data in a visual way, using an interactive dashboard

* Neural Network approach 
** Use one Neural Network model to classify the data (feed forward, RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM , GRU)
** Show metrics with the implementation strategy 

* Transformer Based Approach
** Use a Transformer based / Language Model model to classify the data (BERT/ROBERTA/ALBERT)
** Show metrics with the implementation strategy 

* Compare the models

The project must be developed on Jupyter or Colab, and in a customer-ready form that means
* well-documented
* with descriptions about all the steps 
* all the materials to reproduce them such as data and models.

As all the exams are on Thursdays, Project as to be delivered by previous Tuesday 8pm CET.
