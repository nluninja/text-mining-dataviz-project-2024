# Project track A.Y. 2024-2025 DATA VISUALIZATION & TEXT MINING

The team has to build a text processing pipeline that performs a text classification on the given corpus: all the assigned datasets refer to Entity Extraction use cases, that can be solved applying a text classification approach at token level (Token-based Classification)

The project MUST show:
*	_Data Exploratory Analysis (DEA)_
    * Data preparation, cleaning: to clean the data from the raw dataset provided.
    * Exploratory Data Analysis using Data Visualization tools to show data variables from statistical distribution (frequency, coverage) to linguistic information (pos, depparse, lemmas)
    * LDA or NMF can be used, if needed, for studying the text distribution.

* _Neural Network approach_ 
  * Use one Neural Network type to classify the data (feed forward, RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM , GRU)
  * Show metrics for the implementation strategy 

* _Transformer-based Approach_
  * Use a Transformer based / Language Model model to classify the data (*BERT)
  * Show metrics for the implementation strategy 

* _A comparison about the models_

* _Dashboard_ 
  * the project MUST implement an interactive DashBoard that combines
    * the Data Exploratory Analysis with dynamic charts about the dataset
    * the metrics about the different strategies applied
    * the ability to have a input box to test the categorizer and to see how it works, moving from a model to another. 


## Project Artifacts
The project MUST be developed on Jupyter or Colab, and in a customer-ready form that means
* well-documented
* with descriptions about all the steps 
* all the materials to reproduce them such as data and models, and instruction to run the dashboard - a Github repository is more than welcome


## Datasets
You can find the dataset into your team folder, available in this repository.

## Schedule
As all the exams are on Thursdays, the project as to be delivered by previous Tuesday 8pm CET.
